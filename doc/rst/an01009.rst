AN01009: Optimising USB Audio for stereo output, battery powered devices
########################################################################

This application note characterises the expected power usage of the XMOS
USB Audio reference design running on the `xcore.ai` device, configured for
stereo-out applications. This document then outlines optional changes
to the hardware and firmware, with the goal of reducing power consumption.

This application note assumes that the design comprises an XMOS device to
interface an external DAC over I²S to USB.

The USB Audio reference design is optimised for performance,
configurability and low resource usage. The standard reference design
running on the `xcore.ai` comfortably fits within the USB bus power envelope
with plenty of power available for support components and audio CODECs.

When powering systems from a battery, a fixed amount of energy is
available. Reduction of power dissipation allows the designer to increase
battery life or keep the same battery life for a smaller battery, bringing
cost and form factor savings. By making different design choices and
constraining the original XMOS USB Audio reference design, various power
optimisations can be applied to help achieve these goals.

This application note assumes that the reader is familiar with the
`The XS3 architecture manual <https://www.xmos.com/?s=XM-014007-PS>`_
and the `XMOS USB Audio reference design. <https://www.xmos.com/develop/usb-multichannel-audio/>`_

.. warning::

    This application note describes steps for reducing power and on a `XK-AUDIO-316-MC`
    board since it is readily and commercially available. However, this hardware arrangement of this
    board does not lend itself to an ideal low power configuration. Compromises made and details of
    an ideal configuration are detailed in this document.

********
Overview
********

The power measurements have been made using the following test harness:

- The `XK-AUDIO-316-MC` board. This board has a jumper (J24)
  over which the 5V supply to the core power supply can be monitored. Note
  that this excludes 5V supply to 3V3 and 1V8 pins.

- XMOS USB Audio library ``lib_xua``. The version used was 5.0.0.

- Host: HP ProBook 430 G7 running Windows 11 23H2.

A diagram of the chip power measurement method is in :numref:`fig_power_setup`. There are
multiple power domains within the `xcore.ai` device. In this application, all
power originates from VBUS, and is consumed as core power (0.9V nominal),
1.8V analog (for USB), 3.3V analog (for USB), and either 1.8 or 3.3V for
digital I/O. It is assumed that DC-DC converters with a reasonable
efficiency (not LDOs) are used.

The core voltage power consumption in the 5V domain is measured; the power
consumption of the other supplies is estimated.

            Test setup

For each configuration, basic enumeration and playback was tested on Windows,
and power when playing audio was measured.

*******************
Example application
*******************


An accompanying example application (``app_an01009``) is provided along side this application note.

Building the example
====================

The application uses the `xcommon-cmake <https://www.xmos.com/file/xcommon-cmake-documentation/?version=latest>`_,
the `XMOS` build and dependency management system. `xcommon-cmake` is bundled with the XTC tools.

The ``an01009`` software zip-file should be downloaded and unzipped to a chosen directory.

To configure the build run the following from an XTC command prompt::

    cd an01009
    cd app_an01009
    cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -B build

All required dependencies are included in the software download, however, if any are missing it is
at this configure step that they will be downloaded by the build system.

Finally, the application binary can be built using ``xmake``::

    xmake -j -C build

This command will cause a binary (.xe) to be generated in the `app_an01009/bin` directory,

Launching the example
=====================

From a XTC command prompt run the following command::

    xrun bin/app_an02003.xe

Once this command has executed the device should have enumerated on the host machine.

*************
Optimisations
*************

A number of different optimisations were applied to the reference design and their
impact was measured. These optimisations can be grouped into categories.

* Execute all the software to one physical tile. Then the `xcore` switch and other tile can both be
  slowed down. In this case, the frequency of core 0 is reduced to 9 MHz.
  The hardware that is used for measuring power is suboptimal in this regard since the I²S and I²C
  buses are connected to two separate physical tiles. An extra 3 mW can be saved by switching the
  other tile off rather than just slowing it down.

* Reduce the core voltage to the bottom of the allowed range (0.85V) rather than the middle of the
  allowed range (0.9V)

* Reduction of power by lowering the audio sample frequency to 48 kHz and use of full speed USB
  rather than high-speed.

The latter is important as it affects the non-core power consumed.

Implementation
==============

The source file ``src/extensions/power_down.xc`` contains a function which is run on
application startup to reduce the power consumption. It waits for ten seconds to
allow the application to start running and then it applies the optimisations.

The following clock divider reduces the System PLL frequency of 600 MHz to 120 MHz
for the switch:

.. literalinclude:: ../../app_an01009/src/extensions/power_down.xc
   :start-after: Reduce switch clock frequency
   :end-at: write_node_config_reg

The following clock divider reduces the System PLL frequency of 600 MHz to 9 MHz
for core 0, which is enabled by the write to the ``XS1_PS_XCORE_CTRL0`` register:

.. literalinclude:: ../../app_an01009/src/extensions/power_down.xc
   :start-after: Reduce core 0 clock frequency
   :end-at: setps

Driving a value of 1 on the ``p_margin`` port reduces the core voltage to 0.85V:

.. literalinclude:: ../../app_an01009/src/extensions/power_down.xc
   :start-after: Reduce core voltage to 0.85V
   :end-at: asm volatile

The p_margin port is defined for the `XK-AUDIO-316-MC` board by code in ``lib_board_support``.

These optimisations can be enabled or disabled as required to test the power consumption
by adding or removing them in the ``power_down`` function.

Changing to USB Audio Class 1 is achieved by setting the ``AUDIO_CLASS`` define in
``src/core/xua_conf.h`` to the value ``1``.

.. note::

   Due to the I/O arrangement of the `XK-AUDIO-316-MC` the choice is made to run the software on
   tile[1], a realistic design would choose to run on tile[0] due to the boot flash being connected
   to this tile - thus allowing DFU to operate etc.

I/O power

I/O power is calculated to be as follows (note these have not yet been measured) for USB full-speed
and high-speed operation:

========================= ======================= ======================

Comparison of optimisations
===========================

The tables below show the measured core power consumption of the `xcore.ai` USB Audio
reference design with different optimisations. The calculated I/O power is added to get
the total power consumption value.

The `Configuration` column lists the core 0 and core 1 clock frequencies, followed by the
core voltage.

.. note::

   This application note makes the arbitrary choice to run in UAC1.0 mode when operating at
   full-speed. UAC2.0 vs UAC1.0 will have negligible effect on power, it is the bus-speed
   and sample rate change the elicits power reduction.

**************************************
Hardware for minimal power consumption
**************************************

This application measured the power on an `XK-AUDIO-316-MC` board, as that is commercially available
and has a 0.1 ohm resistor across the 5V input to the core power supply.

In order to build a design that uses minimal power the following steps should be taken, in order of
importance:

* Put all I/O on tile 0; in particular I²S and I²C, and build with tile 0 for I/O and ``lib_xud``.

* In the software switch off tile 1 upon booting (see ``power_down.xc``).

* Design the core power supply so that the VDD pins of the `xcore` device are at 0.85V. The
  supported voltage range is 0.85..0.95V.

* Use a DC-DC converter to generate 1.8V from 5V

* Use 1.8V I/O (for example the `QF60A` part)

* Use a DC-DC to generate 3.3V from 5V (power requirements on 3V3 are very little, so an LDO may
  be an option)

* Minimise power supply on USB suspend

**********
Conclusion
**********

This application note shows how some simple design optimisations can be made to reduce overall
power consumption by 25% compared with the baseline reference design.
